Welcome to this project's README file. 
Here I will be giving some information about the project. 

Phase.1 & Phase.2

We are developing this project for my class Software Engineering.
We will be developing a full stack E-commerce application with PHP.
We will be implementing a database and implement CRUD.

The application will be able to show a list of products, add products to shopping cart (CRUD support), checking out the shopping cart, user login/signup form which will be secured, track previous orders etc...

I have chosen to work based on Agile Incremental Development, since I think the project might change and evolve with the time & also make the development easier for me.

The application will have a home page, with features like a search bar, a dashboard, a listing of products and also adding pagination. 
If the user clicks on one of the products listed in the home page, the user might be able to see more detailed information about the product.
There will be a page for the shopping card and for checking out an order.
