# se-project

Welcome to this project's README file. 
Here I will be giving some information about the project. 

I am developing this project as an individual project for my class Software Engineering.
I will be developing a full stack real-time E-commerce application with Spring Boot as the backend technology & Angular as the frontend technology, integrated together using REST API.
I will be implementing a database and implement CRUD.

The application will be able to show a list of products, add products to shopping cart, checking out the shopping cart, user login/signup form which will be secured, track previous orders etc...
